This project is for a business that offers Dog boarding, grooming, and daycare services. 
Below I will list all the things I want this project to do: 
1. Create file's for all dog's being serviced. 
2. In these files save all the dog's information: 
    Unique Client Identifier, Parent's names and contact info (phone numbers, emails, etc)
    Basic dog information including breed, age, weight, allergies, copies of vaccination records 
    Services provided to dog over the time of their stay 
    Special information pertaining to each stay including the dates of the stay, feeding schedules and quantities, schedule for medicine and quantity if applicable, 
          total costs of services from stay, belongings with dog during stay. 
          
    More to add soon but this is my starting point. Next will be checklists of all the dog's who are on site with all the dog's information for their tenure.

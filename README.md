This project is for a business that offers Dog boarding, grooming, and daycare services. 
Below are some examples what I want to do with the software package  
1. Create file's for all dog's being serviced. 
2. In these files save all the dog's information including special information pertaining to each stay such as the dates of the stay, feeding schedules and quantities, schedule for medicine and quantity if applicable, total costs of services from stay, belongings with dog during stay. 
    
    UPDATE 01/05/2018: Have made significant progress on user interface for setting all information pertaining to dog's stay and saving the files/creating directories. Still have information that needs to be added such as medicinal and feeding information. Also need to fix the boarding cost calculation. In the meantime I want to get started on how the dogs service info will be saved into an excel spreadsheet along with other dogs on given day. This will be known as the dog checklist, showing everyone who is their on a given day and their information altogether for easy access for use in day to day operations.

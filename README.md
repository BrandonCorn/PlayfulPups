This project is for a business that offers Dog boarding, grooming, and daycare services. 
Below I will list all the things I want this project to do: 
1. Create file's for all dog's being serviced. 
2. In these files save all the dog's information: 
    Unique Client Identifier, Parent's names and contact info (phone numbers, emails, etc)
    Basic dog information including breed, age, weight, allergies, copies of vaccination records 
    Services provided to dog over the time of their stay 
    Special information pertaining to each stay including the dates of the stay, feeding schedules and quantities, schedule for medicine and quantity if applicable, total costs of services from stay, belongings with dog during stay. 
    
    UPDATE 10/11/2018: Still working on this, need to add methods for belongings, feeding schedules, medicine schedules, and fix the method for setting a price for dog's boarding.
